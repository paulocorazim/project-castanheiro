# EasyPDO

### What is it?
EasyPDO is small PHP library that provides an easy and secure way to interact with a database. EasyPDO makes writing parameterised queries a breeze, and can dramatically reduce the amount of code you need to write.

### Who initally coded it?
EasyPDO was coded by [Rob Poyntz](mailto:rob@digitalfinery.com.au) and can be found as well [here](http://easypdo.robpoyntz.com/).

### Why was it written?
Originally coded as a private project using PHP's MySQLi drivers, EasyPDO evolved into something which could potentially:

- Save developers time
- Make web applications more secure
- Simplify your codebase
- Help reduce programming errors
- EasyPDO has been tested on MySQL v5.0, SQLite3 and Postgres v8.4. There is a good chance it will work with any of the other databases supported by PDO

Support for MySQLi has been dropped.

### Why this Repo?
I had the need for named placeholders and implemented them. Further, I structured the lib to work with [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).
